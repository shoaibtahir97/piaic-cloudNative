    <h1>Document Object Model</h1>
    <p id="para">JavaScript is used on the browser. HTML is loaded on the window/DOM. <br>
        If you want to access/target something on the HTML you have to use DOM <br>
        The HTML is converted into a document, which has different objects through which 
        we can access elements and perform multiple functions

    <ul>
        <li>
            QuerySelector: It is used to target any element in the HTML document. <br>
            You can pass tag name, id and class. If there are multiple elements with <br>
            the same name then it will return the first element with that name, id or class.
        </li>
        <li>
            QuerySelectorAll: It is used to target all the element in the HTML document. <br>
            It returns an array 
        </li>
        <li>
