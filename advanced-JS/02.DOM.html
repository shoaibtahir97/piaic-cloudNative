    <h1>Document Object Model</h1>
    <p id="para">JavaScript is used on the browser. HTML is loaded on the window/DOM. <br>
        If you want to access/target something on the HTML you have to use DOM <br>
        The HTML is converted into a document, which has different objects through which 
        we can access elements and perform multiple functions 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            QuerySelector: It is used to target any element in the HTML document. <br>
            You can pass tag name, id and class. If there are multiple elements with <br>
            the same name then it will return the first element with that name, id or class.
        </li>
        <li>
            QuerySelectorAll: It is used to target all the element in the HTML document. <br>
            It returns an array 
        </li>
        <li>
            AddEventListener: It is another method of document which takes two parameters. <br>
            First is the event which could be click, change, DOMContentLoaded <br>
            Second parameter is a function which is called when the event is fired <br>
            When using DOMContentLoaded event you just have to pass the function name. No need to call the function <br>
            Because JavaScript itself calls the function when the content is loaded on the browser. <br>
            When DOM content is loaded then the function is executed 
        </li>
        <li>
            element.classList.add('red'): Adds a value of red to the class attribute.
            element.classList.remove('red'): Removes the value of red from the class attribute 
        </li>
        <li>
            forEach: When we use QuerySelectorAll it returns the elements in an array and inside the array <br>
            the method of AddEventListener i not available. To solve this issue we use forEach method to loop <br>
            through the array generated by QuerySelectorAll and call the AddEventListener on each element.
        </li>
    </ul>
